## What Is Virtual Fitting Room?  App Info
Try-on clothes before you buy with our pattern-based 3D garments virtual fitting room. This is a project that aims to generate accurate measurements and utilizes 3D body models of potential customers for fashion brands. 

The powerful data behind the 3D models can then be used for virtual try-on (customer) and pre-production/fit stages (Brands) to bring greater intelligence to the design and product development process.

Siika.io for Made-to-Measure is a simple solution for made-to-measure and bespoke companies which eliminates the time and expense needed to manually measure customers.
